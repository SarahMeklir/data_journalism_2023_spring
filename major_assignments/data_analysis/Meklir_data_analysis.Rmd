data cleaning ideas
- finding census data that matches cities to zipcodes and joining it so we can have a city column
- see which month has the most foreclosures overall
- do outside research about that time of year
- find month with highest percentage of total foreclosures in 2022 because we have all the data

```{r}
md_foreclosure_data <- md_foreclosure_data %>% 
  rename(`February 2022` = `February 2020`)

md_foreclosure_data
  
```

Question 1: a.) Where are there more foreclosure notices? **We just thought of this follow up question, so we're adding it here** b.) Is it different based on pop? Why? 
This is newsworthy because it would give insight into locations that experience higher numbers of debt, allowing a conclusion to be made about the area’s economic state.
- it would help to have cities for this one to generalize the count

// WE HAVE TO SORT BY POP AHHHHH realized this at the end. Another thursday step. All good.

md_data_and_boundaries

write_csv(md_data_and_boundaries, "data/q1_md_data_and_boundaries.csv")
```

Question 2: When were there the fewest or most foreclosure notices? Why?
This would likely indicate a change due to COVID, but I’m not sure whether that change would add more foreclosures or fewer due to the rent extensions the government allowed in the early days of the pandemic.

**Answer**

```{r}

write_csv(md_data_and_boundaries, "data/md_data_and_boundaries.csv")

knitr::include_graphics("~/Documents/data_journalism_2023_spring/major_assignments/data_analysis/data/LOOK_AT_THIS_it_is_a_graph.png")

pivoted_data_and_boundaries <- md_data_and_boundaries %>% 
  pivot_longer(dates=c(`July 2021`, `August 2021`, `September 2021`, `October 2021`, `November 2021`, `December 2021`, `January 2022`, `February 2022`, `March 2022`, `April 2022`, `May 2022`, `June 2022`, `July 2022`, `August 2022`, `September 2022`, `October 2022`, `November 2022`, `December 2022`, `January 2023`, `February 2023`, `March 2023`))
  


```

Question 3: What are the income levels for the most and least foreclosed-upon (noticed) areas and what does the distribution of that look like?
This would show us how the value of homes and the income of people purchasing them differs in different income brackets.

**answer**
- The area with the highest median household income is Showell followed by Bethesda according to the data.
- Areas with the fewest foreclosure notices  have anywhere between no household income (N/A) and the highest income. It was very spread out. We think that's because it's made of government property, airports, and schools.
- Areas with the most foreclosure notices are Upper Marlboro, Raspeburg (a place neither of us has heard of), and Baltimore. They all have comparatively low median household income generally between $30,000 and $50,000. 
- Here is a scatterplot :) It shows that there are more foreclosure notices in the middle-to-low median income zipcodes.
**TO-DO: combine duplicate zips**
```{r}
census_api_key("577bf4d5bf135998c07189afd7dc2e2d621240d6")
ACS5 <- load_variables(2021, "acs5", cache = TRUE) 

MD_household_income <- get_acs(geography = "zcta", state = "MD", variables = "B06011_001", year = 2019)  %>% 
  mutate(GEOID = as.double(GEOID))

md_data_and_boundaries%>% 
  left_join(MD_household_income, by=c("Zip"="GEOID")) %>% 
  mutate(zip_overall_total = `July 2021` + `August 2021` + `September 2021` + `October 2021` + `November 2021` + `December 2021` + `January 2022` + `February 2022` + `March 2022` + `April 2022` + `May 2022` + `June 2022` + `July 2022` + `August 2022` + `September 2022` + `October 2022` + `November 2022` + `December 2022` + `January 2023` + `February 2023` + `March 2023`) %>% 
  group_by(Zip, ZIPNAME, zip_overall_total) %>% 
  summarize(Zip, ZIPNAME, estimate, zip_overall_total) %>% 
  arrange(desc(zip_overall_total)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x=estimate,y=zip_overall_total)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x=estimate,y=zip_overall_total), method="lm")

md_data_and_boundaries
```
**Per capita income for 20772 (the highest number of foreclosures in 2022) is $53,168 according to https://www.incomebyzipcode.com/maryland/20772**
There are a WHOLE lot of zipcodes without any foreclosure notices OR with just one for 2022, so in the next few iterations of this project we'll try to combine zipcode data for each city so we have larger numbers to work with and more accurate population data.



Question 4: What does the racial demographic data look like in the areas of interest?
This is newsworthy because it would give us hard data on any disparities that might exist while comparing the income levels, foreclosure rate, and predominant races being foreclosed on.
- we're having trouble calling from census data, it's showing up the same no matter which variable we use. Let's troubleshoot this in class, it should come together pretty quickly once we figure that part out.
- I don't think our problem here is the variable. I think it's the view we're calling. Because we want to see counts and distributions for race demographics and nothing is coming up remotely close to those results. It's probably a simple fix but we aren't familiar with it. Maybe we just don't know how to read it? I swear we're literate.
```{r}
census_api_key("577bf4d5bf135998c07189afd7dc2e2d621240d6")
ACS5 <- load_variables(2021, "acs5", cache = TRUE) 

MD_demographic_data <- get_acs(geography = "zcta", state = "MD", variables = "B99021_001", year = 2019) 
MD_demographic_data

```

**according to this website (https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/20772/#:~:text=The%20people%20living%20in%20ZIP,than%20average%20number%20of%20families) the demographic data for 20772 is 79% Black and a high proportion of homeowners in their late 20s to early 40s.**

**we are not needing to do a ton of coding for this, let's find a time next week for the three of us to meet so we can discuss ways to deepen the level of coding we do and questions we ask.**

Question 5: How long were people living there before they were foreclosed on? 
I don’t know whether this data is provided but it would be interesting and would allow us to see the frequency of turnover. If we could compare the buying and selling frequency of highly foreclosed areas to that of infrequently foreclosed areas, it would add a new depth to our research.

We think the idea is to load that data and do some adding to find the number of people who've moved away from their houses in that time, but we're not sure how to approach that or whether that's a good idea. We'd love to talk to you in or after class on Tuesday to discuss ideas.
- we think we need to take another step into the data to access it but we can't figure it out but it will all work out :)
- Our last step for this project will be organizing it into more of a report, just want you to know we heard your feedback
